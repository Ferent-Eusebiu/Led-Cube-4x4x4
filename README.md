# Led-Cube-4x4x4
â—‹ I created a cube made out of leds that presents different patterns. Its a fully functional light show with the rain effect and light flicker going up and down.

A 4x4x4 LED cube is an impressive and visually appealing electronic project that involves creating a three-dimensional matrix of LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes). 

This cube consists of 64 LEDs arranged in 4 layers of 16 LEDs each, forming a 4x4x4 structure. 

The project leverages the concept of multiplexing to control each LED individually without requiring 64 separate control lines, significantly simplifying the circuit and reducing the number of required microcontroller pins.
